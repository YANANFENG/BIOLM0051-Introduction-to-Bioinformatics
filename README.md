This repository contains the analysis scripts and data used to identify the species of four seized meat samples. The analysis uses bioinformatics tools, including BLAST for species identification and Clustal Omega for multiple sequence alignment (MSA). The objective is to determine whether the meat samples belong to protected species listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
